ISSUE #1: The game will crash if too many drops are on screen, likely because the size of the list variable is set at
the beginning of the loop and not updated enough times or at the right places? So then it keeps going with its current
list size of moving drops down and when it gets to the last element, it freaks out because it's been destroyed already.

POSSIBLY FIXED: Exit the loop when a drop is removed so the size of the array can be redefined immediately.

ISSUE #2: Mouse Position returns null when leaving the screen, possibly leaving the bucket unable to be moved again.
 -- Only thing I can think of is adding better conditions
 -- Possibly use java Robot class so every time the mouse goes outside of the JFrame or its position regards to the
    JFrame equals null, the robot moves it to the nearest edge of the JFRame

ISSUE #3: Sometimes a rare bug on start up that throws error regarding dropsList being null when something is run;
need to encounter it again to figure out how to fix it.
